A smart home is a residence that uses internet-connected devices to control and automate various household functions. These can include lighting, heating and cooling systems, security systems, and even appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines. Smart homes rely on a network of devices that communicate with each other and can be controlled remotely using a mobile app or voice commands.

Home automation refers to the use of technology to automate routine tasks and control various household functions. This can include setting schedules for lighting and heating systems, monitoring energy usage, and controlling appliances remotely.
